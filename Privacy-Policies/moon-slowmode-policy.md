# Privacy Policy

The use of this application ("Moon Slowmode", "Bot") in a server requires the collection of some specific user data ("Data").  
Use of the Bot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy as well as our [Terms of Service](https://github.com/BellaMoonaria/Moon-Development/blob/main/terms-of-service.md).

## Usage of Data

The Bot may use stored Data, as defined below, for different features including but not limited to:
- Command handling

No usage of Data outside of the aforementioned cases will happen.
Data is and will not be shared with or sold to any Third-Party website or service.

## Storage of Data

The Bot does not store any Data.

### Updating Data

The Data may be updated when using specific commands, which require the input of an end user.  
No other actions may update the stored Data at any given time.

### Temporary Storage of Data

The Bot may keep the stored Data in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

Data may be dropped from cache through actions such as removing the Bot from a server.

## User Rights

At any time, you have the right to request to view the Data pertaining to your personal Discord account as well as the removal of said Data.
You may submit a request through e-mail at bella.moonaria@gmail.com.

## Removal of Data

### Automatic Removal

Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the Bot from a server by either kicking or banning.

The automatic removal of Data has certain limitations that we cannot fix or avoid.
Limitations include, but aren't limited to, downtime of the Bot due to maintenance or technical issues at our hosting provider or Discord Inc.

In such events, you can request [manual removal](#manual-removal).

### Manual Removal

Manual removal of the Data can be requested through e-mail at bella.moonaria@gmail.com.  
For security reasons, we will ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the account or server that you wish the Data to be removed of.

Only a server owner may request manual removal of server related Data.
Requesting manual Data removal will result in Removal of the Bot from the server, if still present on it.

## Underage Users

The use of the Bot is not permitted for minors under the age of 13, or under the age of legal consent for their country.
No information from an underage user will be knowingly stored.
If we receive actual knowledge that anyone under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us without the requisite and verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from the Bot as quickly as is reasonably practical.

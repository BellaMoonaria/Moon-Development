Updating data will require the input of an end user, and data that can be seen as sensitive, such as content of a message, may need to be stored when using certain commands.

No other actions may update the stored information at any given time.

## Temporarily stored Information

The Bot may keep the stored information in an internal cacheing mechanic for a certain amount of time.
After this time period, the cached information will be dropped and only be re-added when required.

In such events, you can request [manual removal](#manual-removal).

### Manual removal

Manual removal of the data can be requested through e-mail at bella.moonaria@gmail.com.
For security reasons, we will ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server that you wish the data to be removed of.
